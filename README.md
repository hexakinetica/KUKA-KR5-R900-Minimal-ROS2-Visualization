## KUKA-KR5-R900-Minimal-ROS2-Visualization

#### ü¶æ Minimal mouse-controlled ROS 2 visualization of the KUKA KR5 R900 sixx industrial robot

This repository provides a **minimal ROS 2 package** that visualizes the **KUKA KR5 R900 sixx** robot in **RViz2** using a simple URDF and mouse-controlls. Quick, visual way to explore the robot model without setting up complex controllers or simulation environments.
